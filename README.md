# Statistical-Analysis-of-the-Adult-Census-Income-Dataset
This repository contains a detailed statistical analysis of the Adult Census Income Dataset, focusing on income level prediction. The project incorporates various statistical techniques and modeling approaches to derive meaningful insights.

Key Highlights:

Statistical Tests: Z-tests, ANOVA, and Tukey's test were employed for comprehensive examination of categorical data, comparing means among different groups and race-levels.

Modeling Techniques: Logistic regression, linear regression, Forward and Backward stepwise selection, Lasso and Ridge Logistic Regression, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were applied.

Best Performer: The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) emerged as the most accurate predictor, achieving an 85.68% accuracy on the test set. It demonstrated effectiveness in capturing non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
